To build the SWC for this library, run the build.xml found in the root of this project with its 
default settings.  Please note that the environment variable FLEX_HOME must be set for this build 
to function correctly.  Please also note that the FlashBuilder project is an application setup to
execute the FlexUnit tests using the UIListener rather than the built-in FlexUnit4 support;
the project cannot be used as a library project.
